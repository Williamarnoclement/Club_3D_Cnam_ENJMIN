# Club 3D Cnam ENJMIN

## About

During the beginning of our school year, I had the opportunity to present different features of the Blender software in the 3D Club of [Cnam ENJMIN](https://enjmin.cnam.fr/enjmin/ecole-nationale-du-jeu-et-des-medias-interactifs-accueil-1126103.kjsp).
I have also set up a system of retransmission of the courses on Youtube.
